<h2>Z-index example:</h2>
<p>We have positioned the divs in our example since Z-index only applies to elements that are positioned (that is having a position value other than “static”). </p>
<p>Also,we bear in mind that an element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order. 
In the example since .yellow  is a “child” of  .red  it sits below the .blue , although that its z-index value is bigger.</p>
